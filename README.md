# json_with_io-_opeartions
This Python code writes and reads JSON data from a file. It defines three functions: one to read JSON from a file, one to write data to a JSON file, and one to print the data. In the main part, the program writes a list of people (with name, age, and city) to a file, then reads the data back and prints it. There's a small error in the print_data function where it should loop through the passed data instead of loaded_data. After fixing that, the program will work as expected.
